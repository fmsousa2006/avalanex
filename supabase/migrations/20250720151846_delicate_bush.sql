  # Disable RLS on stocks table temporarily

  This migration temporarily disables Row Level Security on the stocks table
  to allow the application to insert and update stock records without policy violations.
  
  1. Changes
     - Disable RLS on stocks table
     - Remove existing policies that are causing conflicts
  
  2. Security Note
     - This is a temporary solution to resolve the RLS policy violation
     - The stocks table will be accessible to all authenticated users
     - Consider re-enabling RLS with proper policies once the issue is resolved
